# Getting Started

The code simulates just one experiment, so this should take a little time.

The file `rungaps` can be used to build and operate both the CPU and GPU generators. It has been coded with all the routines (including the one for paper results).

NB: If you get a permission denied error, please run `chmod +x rungaps`.

This should build the program and generate 10000 events on the GPU. The output should look something like this:

```bash
