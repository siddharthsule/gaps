# GAPS - Documentation Home

Welcome to the GAPS Documentation! Here, we go into the computational depths of the GPU algorithm, explaining what everything means and how it all works.

We will divide the documentation into a few sections:

- [Getting Started](sections/getting-started.md): Similar to [README.md](../README.md), this page covers the setting up and basic usage
- [Code Structure](sections/code-structure.md): This contains details of where all params and settings are defined
- [Matrix](sections/matrix-element.md), [Shower](sections/parton-shower.md) and [Observables](sections/observables.md): This contains the descriptions of the different GPU components
- [Validation](sections/validation.md): This contains additional physics validation analyses 

For those who are new to GPU programming, please feel free to check out [GPU Tutorials for the Particle Physicist](https://gitlab.com/siddharthsule/hep-gpu-tutorials), a repository containing GPU programming tutorials in the context of HEP.

For more information/help or if you encounter any issues, feel free to contact [siddharth.sule@manchester.ac.uk](mailto:siddharth.sule@manchester.ac.uk)

Happy Simulating!
