# GAPS - Documentation Home

Welcome to the GAPS Documentation! Here, we go into the computational depths of the GPU algorithm, explaining what everything means and how it all works.

We'll divide the documentation into a few sections:

- [Getting Started](sections/getting-started.md): Similar to [README.md](../README.md), this page covers the setting up and basic usage
- [Code Structure](sections/code-structure.md): This contains details of where all params and settings are defined
- [Matrix](sections/matrix-element.md), [Shower](sections/parton-shower.md) and [Observables](sections/observables.md): This contains the descriptions of the different GPU components

Additionally, the 'tutorials' folder contains introductory CUDA codes available online, which we have added further comments to. (Link to Original codes are also provided!)

For more information/help, feel free to contact [siddharth.sule@manchester.ac.uk](mailto:siddharth.sule@manchester.ac.uk)

Happy Simulating!
