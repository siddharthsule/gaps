# GAPS Codebase

There are four folders in the GAPS Codebase

- **CPU and GPU Shower**: These folder have the C++ and CUDA C++ codes. They are built using CMake.
- **Interface**: The codes are managed and ran using Python. This allows better error handling and UI
- **LHAPDF on GPU**: This is a patched-build of LHAPDF, required to run GAPS.
- **(Prototype) compare.py**: A code that compares gpu and cpu code, and ensures consistency in formulae
